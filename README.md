## Development

The site is built with React on Next.js, Sanity CMS for content management, and Tailwind for styling.

### Getting started

Requirements:

- Node >= 16
- Yarn (`npm i -g yarn`)

No environment variables are required for development, with the exception of the contact page.

To get the site running:

```sh
# Install dependencies
yarn
# Start dev server
yarn dev
```

This serves the site on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
